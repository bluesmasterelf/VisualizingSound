Visualizing Sound is a passion project of mine. I started design for this particular tool from https://gist.github.com/gkhays/e264009c0832c73d5345847e673a64ab 

Which does a fantastic job of building up a moving sine wave in pure javascript and html. I modified it as needed for my purposes, 
which are to visualize chords in a mathematically interesting manner.

same vein. 

To use it, download and open in most OS systems and it will open automatically in your default browser. Select notes from the 
12-tet system and observe the different relationships that emerge that normally you would hear.
